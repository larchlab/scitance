This directly contradicts the claim that no such proteins were identified."

This aligns with the claim that errors were most common during bolus administration and when making up medicines that required multiple-step preparation."

        "CONTRADICTS\nThe claim states that antiretroviral therapy (ART) does not significantly reduce rates of tuberculosis (TB) in people living with HIV (PLHIV) across a broad range of CD4 strata. However, the abstract clearly states that ART is strongly associated with a reduction in the incidence of TB across all CD4 count strata. The hazard ratios provided for each CD4 count category all indicate a significant reduction in TB incidence with ART. Therefore, the abstract contradicts the claim."

        "SUPPORTS\nThe abstract provides evidence that supports the claim. It mentions that upon developing resistance to the drug AZD9291, new mutations in EGFR, such as the C797S mutation, emerge. This is shown in the study where six cases acquired the C797S mutation after developing resistance to AZD9291. The abstract also suggests that these mutations could be the cause of treatment failure, as it highlights the need for therapies that can overcome resistance mediated by the EGFR C797S mutation."

This contradicts the claim that glial calcium waves have not been suggested to play a role in seizures."

This suggests that the expression level of the transcript encoded by pseudogene PTENP1 does indeed have an influence on PTEN expression. The abstract also mentions that PTENP1 exerts a growth-suppressive role, which could be interpreted as functioning as a decoy, as stated in the claim."

        "CONTRADICTS\nThe abstract clearly states that the expression of the autoimmune regulator (Aire), a transcriptional regulator, is inducibly expressed in human and mouse tumor keratinocytes in a K17-dependent manner. This directly contradicts the claim that KRT17 does not modulate the expression of AIRE in diseased epithelia. Furthermore, the abstract suggests that this interaction supports tumor progression and the amplification of inflammatory and immune responses, which contradicts the claim that it does not induce the expression of proinflammatory cytokines and does not support tumor progression."
