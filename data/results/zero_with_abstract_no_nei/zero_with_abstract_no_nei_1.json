        "SUPPORTS\nThe abstract supports the claim as it mentions that most errors occurred when giving bolus doses or making up drugs that required multiple step preparation. This aligns with the claim that errors were most common during bolus administration and when making up medicines that required multiple-step preparation."

        "CONTRADICTS\nThe claim states that antiretroviral therapy (ART) does not significantly reduce rates of tuberculosis (TB) in people living with HIV (PLHIV), especially in those with advanced HIV disease or low CD4 counts. However, the abstract clearly states that ART is strongly associated with a reduction in the incidence of TB across all CD4 count strata, including those with less than 200 cells/\u00b5l, which would typically be considered a low CD4 count. The hazard ratios provided in the abstract all indicate a significant reduction in TB incidence with ART. Therefore, the abstract contradicts the claim."

        "SUPPORTS\nThe abstract discusses a study where cell-free plasma DNA was collected from subjects with advanced lung cancer who had developed resistance to the drug AZD9291. The study found that upon developing resistance to the drug, new mutations in EGFR, such as the C797S mutation, emerged. This supports the claim that sequencing plasma DNA before and after the development of drug resistance indicates that new mutations in EGFR, such as a C797S mutation, emerge and cause treatment failure."

The abstract also mentions that PTENP1 exerts a growth-suppressive role, which could be interpreted as functioning as a decoy."

        "CONTRADICTS\n\nThe abstract clearly states that the expression of the autoimmune regulator (Aire), a transcriptional regulator, is inducibly expressed in human and mouse tumor keratinocytes in a K17-dependent manner. This contradicts the claim that KRT17 does not modulate the expression of the transcriptional regulator AIRE in diseased epithelia. Furthermore, the abstract also states that K17 and Aire are bound to a specific promoter region featuring an NF-\u03baB consensus sequence in a relevant subset of K17- and Aire-dependent proinflammatory genes, contradicting the claim that AIRE does not induce the expression of proinflammatory cytokines and does not support tumor progression."
