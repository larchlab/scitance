        "CONTRADICTS\n\nThe claim states that antiretroviral therapy (ART) does not significantly reduce rates of tuberculosis (TB) in people living with HIV (PLHIV) across a broad range of CD4 strata. However, the abstract clearly states that \"Antiretroviral therapy is strongly associated with a reduction in the incidence of tuberculosis across all CD4 count strata.\" This directly contradicts the claim. The abstract also provides specific hazard ratios for different CD4 count categories, all of which indicate a significant reduction in TB incidence with ART."

This contradicts the claim that integrated care has generally failed in tackling multiple comorbidities."

        "SUPPORTS\nThe abstract discusses a study where cell-free plasma DNA was collected from subjects with advanced lung cancer who had developed resistance to the drug AZD9291. The study found that upon developing resistance to the drug, new mutations in EGFR, such as the C797S mutation, emerged. This directly supports the claim that new mutations in EGFR emerge upon developing TKI resistance, leading to treatment failure."

        "SUPPORTS\nThe abstract supports the claim by stating that PTENP1 is biologically active and can regulate cellular levels of PTEN. This suggests that the expression level of the transcript encoded by pseudogene PTENP1 does indeed influence PTEN expression. Furthermore, the abstract describes PTENP1's role as a 'decoy', which aligns with the claim's description of PTENP1 functioning as a decoy to exert this influence."

        "CONTRADICTS\nThe abstract clearly states that the autoimmune regulator (Aire), a transcriptional regulator, is inducibly expressed in human and mouse tumor keratinocytes in a K17-dependent manner. This contradicts the claim that KRT17 does not modulate the expression of AIRE in diseased epithelia. Furthermore, the abstract suggests that this interaction supports tumor progression and the amplification of inflammatory and immune responses, which contradicts the claim that it does not induce the expression of proinflammatory cytokines and does not support tumor progression."
