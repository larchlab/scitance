This aligns with the claim that errors were most common during bolus administration and when making up medicines that required multiple-step preparation."

This directly contradicts the claim that ART does not significantly reduce rates of TB. The abstract also provides specific hazard ratios for each CD4 count category, all of which indicate a significant reduction in TB incidence with ART."

The abstract discusses a study that found integrated care for chronic physical diseases and depression to be effective in reducing disability and improving quality of life. This suggests that integrated care was successful in this instance, which contradicts the claim that lessons need to be learned from the failure of integrated care in tackling multiple comorbidities."

        "SUPPORTS\nThe abstract discusses a study where cell-free plasma DNA was collected from subjects with advanced lung cancer that had developed resistance to the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor AZD9291. The study found that upon developing resistance to AZD9291, new mutations in EGFR, such as the C797S mutation, emerged. This supports the claim that sequencing plasma DNA before and after the development of drug resistance indicates that new mutations in EGFR emerge and cause treatment failure."

It mentions that a Ca2+ elevation in astrocytes correlates with both the initial development and the maintenance of a focal, seizure-like discharge. This contradicts the claim that glial calcium waves have not been suggested to play a role in seizures."

It states that PTENP1 is biologically active and can regulate cellular levels of PTEN, which is consistent with the claim that PTEN expression is regulated by the expression level of the transcript encoded by pseudogene PTENP1. The abstract also mentions that PTENP1 exerts a growth-suppressive role, which could be interpreted as functioning as a decoy, as stated in the claim."

This contradicts the claim that KRT17 does not modulate the expression of AIRE. Furthermore, the abstract also mentions that K17 and Aire are bound to a specific promoter region featuring an NF-\u03baB consensus sequence in a relevant subset of K17- and Aire-dependent proinflammatory genes, which contradicts the claim that AIRE does not induce the expression of proinflammatory cytokines and does not support tumor progression."
