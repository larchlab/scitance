        "CONTRADICTS\nThe claim states that the replacement of histone H2A with its variant H2A.Z, which destabilizes +1 nucleosomes to accelerate gene activation, is not a major regulatory event. It also claims that H2A.Z is not incorporated into chromatin by SWR-C/SWR1 and is not removed by INO80. However, the abstract contradicts this claim by stating that H3.3 nucleosomes, which are sensitive to salt-dependent disruption, lose H2A/H2B or H2A.Z/H2B dimers. It also states that nucleosome core particles (NCPs) that contain both H3.3 and H2A.Z are less stable than NCPs containing H3.3 and H2A, suggesting that H2A.Z does play a role in the stability of nucleosomes. Furthermore, the abstract mentions that promoters and enhancers at transcriptionally active genes and coding regions at highly expressed genes have nucleosomes that simultaneously carry both H3.3 and H2A.Z, suggesting that H2A.Z is incorporated into chromatin and plays a role in gene activation."

Therefore, it contradicts the claim that the intake of folate and vitamin B6 is associated with reduced levels of homocysteine."

The abstract also mentions that the VgrG spike is involved in penetrating cells, which supports the claim's statement that the spike enables the puncturing of recipient's membranes."

The abstract specifically mentions that they detected an acquired EGFR C797S mutation in one subject, and that this mutation rendered a cell line resistant to AZD9291. Furthermore, they found that upon developing AZD9291 resistance, six cases acquired the C797S mutation. This directly supports the claim that new mutations in EGFR emerge upon developing TKI resistance and cause treatment failure."
