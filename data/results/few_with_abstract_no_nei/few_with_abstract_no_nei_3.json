The abstract also mentions that the study identified more than 800 KLF4 target genes, many of which regulate pro-inflammatory responses of SMCs. This information aligns with the claim's assertion that KLF4 expression and expression of macrophage markers were induced in VSMCs, leading to phagocytic behavior and the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines."

It specifically mentions that nucleosomes that contain both H3.3 and H2A.Z are less stable than those containing H3.3 and H2A, which contradicts the claim that H2A.Z does not destabilize nucleosomes. The abstract also suggests that H2A.Z could play different roles depending on its partners within the nucleosome core particles, which contradicts the claim that H2A.Z is not incorporated into chromatin."
