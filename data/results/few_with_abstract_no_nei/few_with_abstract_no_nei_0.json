This aligns with the claim that KLF4 expression and expression of macrophage markers were induced in VSMCs resulting in phagocytic behavior and the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. The abstract also mentions that SMC-specific conditional knockout of Kr\u00fcppel-like factor 4 (Klf4) resulted in reduced numbers of SMC-derived MSC- and macrophage-like cells, which further supports the claim."

This suggests that the replacement of histone H2A with its variant H2A.Z does indeed have an effect on the stability of nucleosomes, which contradicts the claim that this is not a major regulatory event. Furthermore, the abstract also mentions that promoters and enhancers at transcriptionally active genes and coding regions at highly expressed genes have nucleosomes that carry both H3.3 and H2A.Z, suggesting that H2A.Z is incorporated into chromatin, which also contradicts the claim."

However, it does not mention anything about the intake of these vitamins being associated with reduced levels of homocysteine, which is what the claim states. Therefore, the abstract contradicts the claim."
