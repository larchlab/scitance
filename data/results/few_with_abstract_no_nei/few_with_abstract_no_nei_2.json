        "SUPPORTS\n\nThe abstract supports the claim by discussing how the Kr\u00fcppel-like factor 4 (KLF4) in smooth muscle cells (SMCs) contributes to the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. It mentions that SMC-specific conditional knockout of KLF4 resulted in reduced numbers of SMC-derived macrophage-like cells and a reduction in lesion size. It also states that they identified >800 KLF4 target genes, including many that regulate pro-inflammatory responses of SMCs. This aligns with the claim that KLF4 expression and expression of macrophage markers were induced in VSMCs resulting in phagocytic behavior and the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines."

        "CONTRADICTS\n\nThe claim states that the replacement of histone H2A with its variant H2A.Z, which destabilizes +1 nucleosomes, is not a major regulatory event. However, the abstract suggests that H3.3 nucleosomes, which are sensitive to salt-dependent disruption, are partnered with either H2A or H2A.Z. It also suggests that nucleosomes that contain both H3.3 and H2A.Z are even less stable than those containing H3.3 and H2A. This implies that the replacement of H2A with H2A.Z does have a significant effect on the stability of nucleosomes, contradicting the claim. Furthermore, the abstract states that promoters and enhancers at transcriptionally active genes and coding regions at highly expressed genes have nucleosomes that simultaneously carry both H3.3 and H2A.Z, suggesting that this replacement does play a role in gene activation."

Therefore, it contradicts the claim that the intake of folate and vitamin B6 is associated with reduced levels of homocysteine."

The abstract mentions that they detected an acquired EGFR C797S mutation in one subject, and that this mutation rendered a cell line resistant to AZD9291. Furthermore, the abstract also states that upon developing AZD9291 resistance, six cases acquired the C797S mutation. This directly supports the claim that new mutations in EGFR emerge upon developing TKI resistance and cause treatment failure."

However, the abstract clearly states that K17 (another name for KRT17) does indeed upregulate the expression of AIRE in tumor keratinocytes, and that this interaction is necessary for the timely onset of skin tumorigenesis in mice. Furthermore, the abstract mentions that K17 and AIRE are both bound to a specific promoter region in a subset of K17- and Aire-dependent proinflammatory genes, suggesting that AIRE does in fact induce the expression of proinflammatory cytokines.
