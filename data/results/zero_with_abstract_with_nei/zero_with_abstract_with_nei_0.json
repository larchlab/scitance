It states that AgDscam responds to infection by producing pathogen challenge-specific splice form repertoires and mediates phagocytosis of bacteria. This supports the claim that Dscam1 could act as a hypervariable pattern-recognition receptor for the immune system."

The abstract states that among patients on long-term dialysis who were part of randomized, controlled trials and receiving antihypertensive drug therapy, the overall benefit of antihypertensive therapy compared with the control or placebo group had a combined hazard ratio for cardiovascular events of 0.69 (95% CI: 0.56 to 0.84) using a fixed-effects model and 0.62 (95% CI: 0.45 to 0.86) using a random-effects model. This suggests that the risk of cardiovascular events can be reduced by antihypertensive drug therapy among hemodialysis patients, especially when they are hypertensive, which is what the claim states."
