It mentions that the overall benefit of antihypertensive therapy compared with the control or placebo group had a combined hazard ratio for cardiovascular events of 0.69 using a fixed-effects model and 0.62 using a random-effects model. This indicates a reduction in the risk of cardiovascular events, which aligns with the claim. Furthermore, the abstract also states that \"Randomized trials suggested a benefit of antihypertensive therapy among hemodialysis patients,\" which directly supports the claim."
