The abstract states that the overall benefit of antihypertensive therapy compared with the control or placebo group had a combined hazard ratio for cardiovascular events of 0.69 using a fixed-effects model and 0.62 using a random-effects model. This suggests a reduction in cardiovascular events, which supports the claim. Furthermore, the abstract also states that randomized trials suggested a benefit of antihypertensive therapy among hemodialysis patients, which also supports the claim."
