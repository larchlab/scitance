The abstract supports this claim by stating that plasma fibrinogen concentration was the most important variable predicting graft occlusion. It also states that patency was significantly higher in patients with a plasma fibrinogen concentration below the median than in those with a concentration above. This indicates that a high fibrinogen concentration (hyperfibrinogenemia) is associated with a higher rate of graft occlusion, which is a form of thrombosis."

The abstract supports this claim by discussing the requirement for specific histone demethylases, including LSD1, to permit ligand- and signal-dependent activation of regulated gene expression. It also mentions an inhibitory methylation component of the histone code that prevents unliganded nuclear receptors from causing constitutive gene activation in the absence of stimulating signals. This aligns with the claim's assertion about the role of histone methylation and demethylation in nuclear receptor function."
